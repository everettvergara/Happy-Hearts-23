# HappyHearts23

Happy Heart's Day Animation in C++ / SDL for my fellow devs. Not the best animation and not very well optimized but this will do =)

If you're only interested in the animation, just download the files under 

```
bin-win
```

If you're interested in the heart equation:

```
r(t) = 2.0 - 2.0 * sin(t) + sin(t) * sqrt(abs(cos(t)) / (sin(t) + 1.4);

where t = teta, 0 to <360 degrees.
Graph it in Polar form.

```

For questions, just send me a private msg.
